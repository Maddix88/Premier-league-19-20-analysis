An brief analysis of Premier league player's stats from 19/20 season

Football and the Premier league are personal interests of mine. I have always been intrigued about the stats and how much match results are influenced by the players whose talent create a wide plethora of statistics to record and interrogate. I intend to analyse the 2019/2020 season by scraping the player match statistics and cleaning the data before performing an ananlysis for my personal development.
